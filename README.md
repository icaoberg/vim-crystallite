# Crystallite

Crystallite is a theme for VIM text editor that tries to look dark & colorful.
It started off with a VIM theme picker, but I eventually ended up tweaking
many things just by hand.

Fully supported languages:
+ Python
+ Pascal

+ C, C++
+ CMake

+ CSS
+ JavaScript
+ PHP
+ MySQL (probably also SQL)
